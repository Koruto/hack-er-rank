## Event details :
- Register anytime between September 26 and October 31
- Pull requests can be made in any GITHUB or GITLAB hosted project that’s participating in Hacktoberfest (look for the “hacktoberfest” topic)
- Project maintainers must accept your pull/merge requests for them to count toward your total
- Have 4 pull/merge requests accepted between October 1 and October 31 to complete Hacktoberfest
- The first 40,000 participants (maintainers and contributors) who complete Hacktoberfest can elect to receive one of two prizes: a tree planted in their name, or the Hacktoberfest 2022 t-shirt

## HacktoberFest Rules :

To earn your Hacktoberfest tee or tree reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 (in any time zone). Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/project. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest. Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count. If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the project’s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
